Bruce Force => Linear Search Algorithm

Greedy => Dijkstra's Algo, Prim's Algo, Kruskal's Algo

Divide and Conquer 
=> divide the problem into sub-problems which give partial solutions and can be recombined [if-   statement] to determine the over all solutions. 
Ex. [Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Tower Of Hanoi]

Dynamic Programming 
=> break down into smaller sub-problems. 
Ex. Fibo Sequence && Climbing staircase

Backtracking 
=> similar to Bruce Force, check if the solution satifies the given contrains
. If the constrains is not satisfied. Backtrack and go on a different path.

What is a data structure ?


 a data structure is a way to store data so that it can be used effeciently.
 a data structure is a collections of data, the relationships among them and 
 the functions that can be applied to that data;
 the data that it is being modeled in a certain way.

ARRAYS 
// hold a collection of values
// contain a mix of data types [string, number, boolean, objects]
// resizable
// zero-indexed || order is maintained
// iterable ex. for-of
// has built-in methods like =  map, filter, concat, slice, splice
// can contain duplicate values


OBJECTS 
// unordered collections of key-value pairs;
// the key must be a string or symbol and the value must be of any type;
// to retrieve a value you can use the corresponding key. It can be achieved either with dot(.) notation or bracket [] notation
// objects are not iterable


SETS
// holds a collection of values however it must be unique
// contain a mix of data types [string, number, boolean, objects]
// dynamically sized
// do not maintain an insertion order
// iterables 
// can not contain duplicate values || will not give an error but it will ignore duplicates
// define using a constructor


MAPS
// ordered collections of key-value pairs
// to retrieve you can use the corresponding key
// maps are iterables. they can be used with a for-loop

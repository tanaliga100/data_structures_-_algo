 STACKS
= last in first out (LIFO)
= the last element that is inserted is the first element to be removed 
= abstract data type
= supports to main operations || push && pop or add && remove
= usage are :
=  brower history tracking
=  undo operation when typing
=  expression conversions
=  call stack in JS runtime
= push(element) = add an element to the top of the stack
= pop(element) = remove an element from the top of the stack
= peek(element) = see the element from the top of the stack || without removing
= isEmpty(element) = check if the stack is empty
= size(element) = check the number of elements in the stack
= print(element) = visualize the elements in the stack


 QUEUE
= sequential collections of elements
= follow the FIFO principles
= the first element that is inserted is the first element to be removed 
= abstract data types
= supports to main operations || enqueue && dequeue
= enqueue adds an element to the tail/rear of the collection
= dequeue removes an element from the head/front of the collection
= usage are : callback || js runtime
